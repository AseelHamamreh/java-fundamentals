## [Lab: 01 - Java primitives and control flow](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab1)

### pluralize method :
a method accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

### flipNHeads method :
a method that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.

### clock method :
a method hat uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time should only be printed once. Your program should detect when the seconds increase and only print something out when the timestamp changes.

## [Lab-02: basicslibrary](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab2)

### Rolling Dice method :
a method that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls.

### Contains Duplicates method :
a method that returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.

### Calculating Averages method :
a method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

### Arrays of Arrays method :
Given an array of arrays calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.

## [lab-3: Maps, File I/O, and Testing](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab3-linter)

1. Analyzing Weather Data method:
In this method we need to find the minimum and the maximum values inside a matrix and then search for each unique element in the array and return it.

2. Tallying Election method:
In this method I reacted a function that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.

## [Lab-6: Composition and Inheritance, Part 1](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab5-inheritance)

In this lab, I created two classes to represent reviews of restaurants and make it works to get the required results without using Inheritance or interfaces.

***

## [Lab-7: Composition and Inheritance, Part 2](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab5-inheritance)

In this lab I used Interfaces to prevent reduplicate the code.
several classes are added to be reviewd and one of the **Theater** class has new methods to add and remove elements. also, it has a new properity to be reviewd.
