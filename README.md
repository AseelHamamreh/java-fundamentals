## [lab-3: Maps, File I/O, and Testing](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab3-linter)

1. Analyzing Weather Data method:
In this method we need to find the minimum and the maximum values inside a matrix and then search for each unique element in the array and return it.

2. Tallying Election method:
In this method I reacted a function that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.

## [Lab-6: Composition and Inheritance, Part 1](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab5-inheritance)

In this lab, I created two classes to represent reviews of restaurants and make it works to get the required results without using Inheritance or interfaces.

## [Lab-7: Composition and Inheritance, Part 2](https://github.com/AseelHamamreh/java-fundamentals/tree/main/basiclibrary/lab5-inheritance)

In this lab I used Interfaces to prevent reduplicate the code.
